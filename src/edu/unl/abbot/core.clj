  ; Apparently, the only truly reliable way to check that a text file
  ; is indeed an XML file is to parse it.  The XML declaration is

  ; have a byte order mark.  The .xml extension is everywhere used
  ; in the specification, but nowhere mandated.
  ;
  ; So we check that the file is, in fact, a file, and demand an .xml
  ; extension.  Notification of more insidious file errors will have
  ; to be left to Saxon.
