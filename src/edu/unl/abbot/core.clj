  ;; have a byte order mark.  The .xml extension is everywhere used
  ;; in the specification, but nowhere mandated.
  ;;
  ;; So we check that the file is, in fact, a file, demand an .xml
  ;; extension, and, if the user has passed the quarantine switch,
  ;; parse the file and see if it validates.  If the user doesn't
  ;; opt to quarantine invalid files, errors are left to Saxon.
